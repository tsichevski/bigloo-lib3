@include version.texi

@code{bigloo-lib} is a collection of libraries for Bigloo, the Scheme
programming language compiler
(@url{http://www-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Bigloo/}). Most of the libraries are
ready-to-use interfaces for various C-based packages, such as C runtime
library, Gtk++, LDAP client API or XML parser API. Other are done
entirely in `pure Scheme', such as HTTP library and NODE library.

Besides, the @code{bigloo-lib} provides a comfortable framework to
configure, compile, install and deploy Bigloo (in particular,
system-dependent) libraries, so it is quite a good place to put code
created by other Bigloo developers.

Currently @code{bigloo-lib} includes the following subpackages:

@itemize @bullet
@item Common utilities (used by all other packages)
@item RDBMS interface including Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite back-ends
@item HTTP+CGI (CGI programming framework)
@item XML parser (interface to James Clark's expat library )
@item LDAP client interface
@item interface for GTK+-1.2
@item interface to GD (GIF/PNG image processing library)
@item interface to gdbm
@end itemize

Besides, @code{bigloo-lib} includes a few @emph{experimental} (and
undocumented) modules:

@itemize @bullet
@item OpenGL interface, including gtkglarea
@item interface to pthread, Posix Threads
@item interface to Unix sockets
@item interface to curl library @url{http://curl.haxx.se/}
@item interface to the GNU Gettext Utilities
@item interface to the GNU Readline Library
@end itemize

@section Documentation

The documentation you see at project WEB site may differ from the
documentation provided with the latest distribution of
@code{bigloo-lib}. Sometimes the documentation reflects the development
"bleeding edge", some of the features described there will only be visible in
the next release. Use the documentation included in the package.

@section Download

@url{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3455}

@emph{Note:} in an upcoming @value{EDITION} release of
@code{bigloo-lib} an attempt will be made to separate each library in
bigloo-lib into its own package. Also, an RPM package will be
available both for each subpackage as well as entire @code{bigloo-lib}
package.

@section Anonymous CVS Access 

@c Note: due to some technical reasons, the CVS updates of
@c @code{bigloo-lib} at SourceForge are temporary discontinued, so the CVS
@c repository contents may be out-of-date comparing with the latest
@c release!

This project's CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous
(pserver) CVS with the following instruction set. When prompted for a
password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key.

@example
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.bigloo-lib.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bigloo-lib login

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.bigloo-lib.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bigloo-lib co .
@end example

@c Updates from within the module's directory do not need the -d parameter.

Also, you can browse the CVS tree with CVSWEB

@url{http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi?cvsroot=bigloo-lib}

Daily tarballs of entire project CVS Repository are available at

@url{http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/bigloo-lib-cvsroot.tar.gz}

@emph{Note:} After you have checked @code{bigloo-lib} for a first time,
you'll probably need to build a few files that are missing in CVS
repository. To do so you you will need the @code{autoconf-2.59},
@code{automake-1.8.5} and @code{libtool-1.5.8} installed on your system
(see @url{ftp://ftp.gnu.org}).

@c @emph{Note:} This version of @code{bigloo-lib} doesn't work with
@c @code{autoconf-2.13} and @code{automake-1.4-pl6} which were used in
@c previous releases of @code{bigloo-lib}.

To create the missing files run:

@example
chmod +x ./bootstrap
./bootstrap
@end example

When compile and install the package as usual (i.e. do
@code{./configure}, @code{make}, @code{make check} and @code{make
install}.
