%description

   The `bigloo-xml' is a command-line tool that can help in developing
packages for `BMC Patrol' <http://www.bmc.com>. `bigloo-xml' manages a
project as a single unit, supports the whole project life-cycle.

   On input, `bigloo-xml' reads an XML file as the only source of
project-related information, and then processes it in batch mode. The
format of that file is suitable both for manual creation, and for
processing by any XML-processing tool as well.

   On output `bigloo-xml' produces a complete set of files, which are ready
for loading to `PATROL(C) Agent' with `PATROL(C) Developer Console'.

   `bigloo-xml' automates many repeating development tasks by means of a
number of built-in filters. `bigloo-xml' embeds a high-level programming
language Scheme, which allows an advanced developer to create his/her
own custom filters.
