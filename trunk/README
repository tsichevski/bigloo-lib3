   `bigloo-lib' is a collection of libraries for Bigloo, the Scheme
programming language compiler
(`http://www-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Bigloo/'). Most of the libraries are
ready-to-use interfaces for various C-based packages, such as C runtime
library, Gtk++, LDAP client API or XML parser API. Other are done
entirely in `pure Scheme', such as HTTP library and NODE library.

   Besides, the `bigloo-lib' provides a comfortable framework to
configure, compile, install and deploy Bigloo (in particular,
system-dependent) libraries, so it is quite a good place to put code
created by other Bigloo developers.

   Currently `bigloo-lib' includes the following subpackages:

   * Common utilities (used by all other packages)

   * RDBMS interface including Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite
     back-ends

   * HTTP+CGI (CGI programming framework)

   * XML parser (interface to James Clark's expat library )

   * LDAP client interface

   * interface for GTK+-1.2

   * interface to GD (GIF/PNG image processing library)

   * interface to gdbm

   Besides, `bigloo-lib' includes a few _experimental_ (and
undocumented) modules:

   * OpenGL interface, including gtkglarea

   * interface to pthread, Posix Threads

   * interface to Unix sockets

   * interface to curl library `http://curl.haxx.se/'

   * interface to the GNU Gettext Utilities

   * interface to the GNU Readline Library

0.4 Documentation
=================

The documentation you see at project WEB site may differ from the
documentation provided with the latest distribution of `bigloo-lib'.
Sometimes the documentation reflects the development "bleeding edge",
some of the features described there will only be visible in the next
release. Use the documentation included in the package.

0.5 Download
============

`http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3455'

   _Note:_ in an upcoming 0.21 release of `bigloo-lib' an attempt will
be made to separate each library in bigloo-lib into its own package.
Also, an RPM package will be available both for each subpackage as well
as entire `bigloo-lib' package.

0.6 Anonymous CVS Access
========================

This project's CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous
(pserver) CVS with the following instruction set. When prompted for a
password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key.

     cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.bigloo-lib.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bigloo-lib login

     cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.bigloo-lib.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bigloo-lib co .

   Also, you can browse the CVS tree with CVSWEB

   `http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi?cvsroot=bigloo-lib'

   Daily tarballs of entire project CVS Repository are available at

   `http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/bigloo-lib-cvsroot.tar.gz'

   _Note:_ After you have checked `bigloo-lib' for a first time, you'll
probably need to build a few files that are missing in CVS repository.
To do so you you will need the `autoconf-2.59', `automake-1.8.5' and
`libtool-1.5.8' installed on your system (see `ftp://ftp.gnu.org').

   To create the missing files run:
